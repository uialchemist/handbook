# Who does what?
Figuring out who to bring a particular issue or question to shouldn't be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at Florence, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at Florence is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction.

## Teams
We have five primary teams at Florence, all sharing the overarching company goal of matching nurses with shifts.

1. Exec Team - working on company direction and operations
2. Tech Team - developers and designers working on building and improving the digital products
3. Marketing Team - working on user acquisition and PR
4. Client Sales Team - working on acquiring new care homes and clients
5. Customer Success Team - working on nurse onboarding and retention

## Tech Team Structure
Within the tech team we have the following verticals:

0. Skunkworks - this team is the birthplace of standalone side projects and experimental features for the core products. Quick dirty hacks, guerilla marketing and MVP projects are some of the things this team focuses on.

1. Core Products - this team maintains, improves and extends our mature products like Florence (marketplace matching nurses with care homes) and Florence Academy (training platform for nurses). Core Products is led by Tom Wilshere (Principal Developer).

2. Mobile Apps - this team maintains, improves and extends our iOS and Android apps. Mobile Apps is led by Pete Morris (Senior iOS Developer).

Every vertical has its own Senior UI Designer, and all verticals are overseen by a Senior UX Architect and report to the CPO.
