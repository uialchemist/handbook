# Who does what?

Figuring out who to bring a particular issue or question to shouldn't be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at Florence, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at Florence is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you're probably not the first, so speak up!

Below you'll find a list of the major groups and teams within the company.
