# Applying for a job
We are always on the lookout for exceptional talent, so even if you haven't found us via a job listing it's always worth getting in contact to see if you'll be a good fit at Florence. Keep in mind that _all interviews are done in person_ at our central London offices and never over the phone.

Here is how the job application works at Florence:

1. Send us an email at ib@florence.co.uk, say hi and let us know your availability over the next few days.
2. Come down to our offices (right next to Liverpool Street station) for an informal introduction chat, normally just takes about 20-30 minutes. The main purpose of this meeting is for us to make sure you are not a psychopath, and for you to make sure we aren't either. ;)
3. If we are all still happy with each other after this chat, we'll have you come in again to meet the key people in the company, again very informal chats. You can have a look at some stuff we're working on currently, and you can ask more in-depth questions if needed.
4. I know you were expecting another step, but that's it. We do not perform any types of coding tests, for a [multitude of reasons](https://github.com/team-florence/handbook/blob/master/coding-tests.md), and there is no panel or committee making any decisions. Your personality and culture fit is infinitely more important than anything else.
