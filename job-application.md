# Applying for a job at Florence
We are always on the lookout for exceptional talent, so even if you haven't found us via a job listing it's always worth getting in contact to see if you'll be a good fit at Florence. Keep in mind that _all second-stage interviews are done in person_ at our central London offices and never over the phone.

Here is how the job application works at Florence:

1. You will have a phone call with Samantha Mann (Florence's Talent Manager) just for a quick intro.
2. You'll then come down to our offices (right next to Liverpool Street station) for an informal introduction chat, normally just takes about 20-30 minutes. The main purpose of this meeting is for us to make sure you are not a psychopath, and for you to make sure we aren't either. ;)
3. If we are all still happy with each other after this chat, we'll have you come in again to meet the key people in the company, again very informal chats. You can have a look at some stuff we're working on currently, and you can ask more in-depth questions if needed.
4. I know you were expecting another step, but that's it. We do not perform any types of coding tests or design tasks, for a [multitude of reasons](https://github.com/team-florence/handbook/blob/master/coding-tests.md), and there is no panel or committee making any decisions. Your personality and culture fit is infinitely more important than anything else.

If that sounds like a good plan, please send an email to samantha@florence.co.uk to get things started. If you are applying for a designer position, please attach your portfolio.
