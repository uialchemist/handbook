# Coding tests
We don't do them. Here is why:

* How you perform on a test is not how you perform in real life
* The best developers in the world still use Stack Overflow on a daily basis to find solutions or to remind themselves of forgotten knowledge, so your ability to memorise complicated code in order to whiteboard something is completely unnatural
* We're not that kind of company

So how do we know you're a good coder? Well, we can take a look at your GitHub, at other projects you have worked on, etc...but we can also draw conclusions on other things like how you speak about code. If you love coding and see this as your career path, you will learn quickly. Also, although we are making some complicated things here at Florence, we're not exactly trying to solve the grand unification theory. You don't need to be the best developer in the universe on day one.

The most important thing we look at is personality and culture fit. If that all checks out, coding is secondary.
