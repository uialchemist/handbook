# Our values
Florence is a place that champions independence and versatility. We want every team member to feel like they are in control of their careers and work/life balance. It's extremely important to us that your workspace feels like a home away from home, with people you trust and enjoy working with.

### Autonomy
The ability to work independently and making micro-decisions all day without the need to check in with a co-worker is something we value highly at Florence. We trust you. That's why we hired you. We work on problems together if you feel stuck, and **you can always ask for help** or more information on a problem but no one is going to make decisions on your behalf.

### User-centric thinking
Every single decision made on a software level should be from the perspective of the user. Put yourself in their shoes and think about how a certain feature will be used. Does it have to be this complicated or is there a simpler solution? Is the feature even needed in the first place? Assume every user is allergic to tech - how can we help them? If the user is struggling, it's our fault.

### Simplicity
Spend as little time as humanly possible on one problem. The "best" or most elegant way is usually very time-consuming and only needed for a full release. Do you really need to spend five days building something if the worst case scenario is acceptable? This type of thinking should be applied to every decision you make, big or small: MVP first, extend later.

### Always say no
It's important to not just say yes and jump into every request. If someone from the company suggests a new feature, start by saying no. Then ask them to defend their position on why this feature should be implemented. The burden of proof is on them to prove why it's a good idea. Why is this feature needed? What is the problem they are trying to solve? Is there a better or simpler solution? What's the worst case scenario if we don't implement this feature? We have to make sure we don't end up spending time on things that haven't been properly examined.

### It's just a job
It's tempting to put in a lot of hours for whatever reasons. Maybe you're in the zone, maybe you have a subconscious drive to impress your co-workers - maybe you even feel pressured to do so. But please don't. You should look forward to going to work, but it's just a job at the end of the day. If you feel you aren't getting anything done today, go home. If you're a morning person that want to start work at 6am so you can go home after lunch, do so. If you're feeling stressed about working here, something has gone wrong.

## Overall company values
In addition to the above product team specific values, Florence also has a set of company values that covers all teams. The company values can seem a bit fluffy, but they very accurately describe the current Florence workplace and are cornerstones in the hiring process.

**Care about what you do**  
_People that care make a bigger difference_

**Embrace the adventure**  
_Drive change and be part of something special_  
Florence changes a lot. We change the product often, we move around, we hire new people, we change targets and we sometimes make quick decisions. If you're scared of change and dislike bold decisions, Florence is not for you.

**Always ask another question**  
_Be curious, you never know where the answer will take you_

**Put yourself in their shoes**  
_Our users are at the centre of everything we do_

**Build a positive team**  
_Be inclusive and accept each otherâ€™s differences_
