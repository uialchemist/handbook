# Our values
Florence is a place that champions independence and versatility. We want every team member to feel like they are in control of their careers and work/life balance, and we want every team member to be able to switch gears on a daily basis.

### Autonomy
The ability to work independently and making micro-decisions all day without the need to check in with a senior is something we value highly at Florence. We trust you. That's why we hired you. We work on problems together if you feel stuck, but no one is ever going to make decisions on your behalf.

### User-centric thinking
Every single decision made on a software level should be from the perspective of the user. Put yourself in their shoes and think about how a certain feature will be used. Does it have to be this complicated or is there a simpler solution? Is the feature even needed in the first place? Assume every user is allergic to tech - how can we help them?

### Simplicity
Spend as little time as humanly possible on one problem. The "best" or most elegant way is usually very time-consuming. Do you really need to spend five days building something if the worst case scenario is actually rare and/or acceptable? This type of thinking should be applied to every decision you make, big or small.

### Always say no
It's important to not just say yes and jump into every request. If someone from the company suggests a new feature, start by saying no. Then ask them to argue why this feature should be implemented. The burden of evidence is on them to prove why it's a good idea. Why is this feature needed? What is the problem they are trying to solve? Is there a better or simpler solution? What's the worst case scenario if we don't implement this feature? Saying no or playing devil's advocate isn't meant to annoy or be perceived as stubborn or contrarian, but to make sure we end up spending time on things that have been properly thought through.

### It's just a job
It's tempting to put in a lot of hours for whatever reasons. Maybe you're in the zone, maybe you have a subconscious drive to impress your co-workers, maybe you feel pressured to do so. But please don't. You should look forward to going to work, but it's just a job at the end of the day. If you feel you aren't getting anything done today, go home. If you feel like you'd rather work on this specific problem from home for a few days, do that.
