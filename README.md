# Florence Employee Handbook

This handbook attempts to clarify who we are as a company, what our values are and what you should expect from a career at Florence. It's primarily aimed towards the product team, but some of these values overlap into the entire company.

## Sections
* [Our values](https://github.com/team-florence/handbook/blob/master/our-values.md)
* [Who does what?](https://github.com/team-florence/handbook/blob/master/who-does-what.md)
* [Titles for developers](https://github.com/team-florence/handbook/blob/master/job-titles.md)
* [Day-to-day workflows](https://github.com/team-florence/handbook/blob/master/day-to-day.md)

***

_Most of this handbook has been completely lifted from Basecamp's employee handbook, because they are awesome._
